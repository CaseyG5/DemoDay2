## "Problem"

Replicate the following web pages:
- yahoo.com
- news.yahoo.com 
- sports.yahoo.com
- news.yahoo.com/covid

Begin on 6/1 and deliver by 6/11

## Solution

### Method:  
We coded and debugged these pages individually with HTML + CSS and joined
them together. Since the navigation and search bars are very similar from 
page to page, these styles were put in a base CSS file.

### Process:  scoping, branching, merging, and deploying
Our team...
- Divided work to be completed
- Created our own branches (e.g. feat/sports)
- Made commits and created pull requests to share updates, and
- Merged everything together
- Deployed for presentation

### Tools:
- PhpStorm IDE for production
- Responsively for inspection of dimensions, colors, etc.
- GitHub for collaboration / version control
- Vercel for publishing the final product

### Results:
Eleasah completed the following pages:  
- index.html
- index.css
- news.yahoo.html
- news.yahoo.css

Casey took care of: 
- sports.yahoo.html
- sports.yahoo.css
- nav.css
